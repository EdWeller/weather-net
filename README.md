A simple client for [OpenWeatherMap API] (http://openweathermap.org/) written in .NET C# 4.0 and .NET Core (UWP).
 
####Features

- OpenWeatherMap Api 2.5

- Search by city name, geographic coordinates or city ID

- Multiple language and units of measure

Types of weather data supported:

- Current weather
- 5 days forecsat (every 3 hours)
- 16 days forecast (daily)



####Usage
```c#
var result =  CurrentWeather.GetByCityName("Stockholm", "Sweden", "en", "metric");
```
Additional usage examples included in the test project.

The UWP-Version makes use of the async-await-pattern. Therefore the call above changes to:

```

####Dependencies
* JSON.net

####Nuget package
Available at [https://www.nuget.org/packages/WeatherNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WeatherNet)
The UWP-NuGet-Packages needs some more time. I've never done this before. :)
